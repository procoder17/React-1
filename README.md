# How to build/run the App

### Requirements for React Native on Mac

- OS X
- Xcode 6.3 or higher is recommended (Xcode only runs on Mac).
- Homebrew is the recommended way to install node, watchman, and flow.
- `brew install node`
- `brew install watchman`. We recommend installing watchman, otherwise you might hit a node file watching bug.
- `brew install flow`. If you want to use flow.

### Running the App

- `npm install` to install all the dependencies, React and React Native among others.
- Open `iosApp.xcodeproj` and hit run in Xcode.
- Hit `cmd+R` in your iOS simulator to reload the App and see your change!

# Run the tests

To run the tests, simply run:

```
npm test
```
